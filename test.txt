Installation guide
Jump to navigationJump to search
This document is a guide for installing Arch Linux from the live system booted with the official installation image. Before installing, it would be advised to view the FAQ. For conventions used in this document, see Help:Reading. In particular, code examples may contain placeholders (formatted in italics) that must be replaced manually.
For more detailed instructions, see the respective ArchWiki articles or the various programs' man pages, both linked from this guide. For interactive help, the IRC channel and the forums are also available.
Arch Linux should run on any x86_64-compatible machine with a minimum of 512 MB RAM. A basic installation with all packages from the base group should take less than 800 MB of disk space. As the installation process needs to retrieve packages from a remote repository, this guide assumes a working internet connection is available.

Pre-installation
The installation media and their GnuPG signatures can be acquired from the Download page.
Verify signature
It is recommended to verify the image signature before use, especially when downloading from an HTTP mirror, where downloads are generally prone to be intercepted to serve malicious images.
On a system with GnuPG installed, do this by downloading the PGP signature (under Checksums) to the ISO directory, and verifying it with:
$ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --verify archlinux-version-x86_64.iso.sig
Alternatively, from an existing Arch Linux installation run:
$ pacman-key -v archlinux-version-x86_64.iso.sig
Note:
The signature itself could be manipulated if it is downloaded from a mirror site, instead of from archlinux.org as above. In this case, ensure that the public key, which is used to decode the signature, is signed by another, trustworthy key. The gpg command will output the fingerprint of the public key.
Another method to verify the authenticity of the signature is to ensure that the public key's fingerprint is identical to the key fingerprint of the Arch Linux developer who signed the ISO-file. See Wikipedia:Public-key_cryptography for more information on the public-key process to authenticate keys.
Boot the live environment
The live environment can be booted from a USB flash drive, an optical disc or a network with PXE. For alternative means of installation, see Category:Installation process.
Pointing the current boot device to a drive containing the Arch installation media is typically achieved by pressing a key during the POST phase, as indicated on the splash screen. Refer to your motherboard's manual for details.
When the Arch menu appears, select Boot Arch Linux and press Enter to enter the installation environment.
See README.bootparams for a list of boot parameters, and packages.x86_64 for a list of included packages.
You will be logged in on the first virtual console as the root user, and presented with a Zsh shell prompt.
To switch to a different console—for example, to view this guide with ELinks alongside the installation—use the Alt+arrow shortcut. To edit configuration files, nano, vi and vim are available.
Set the keyboard layout
The default console keymap is US. Available layouts can be listed with:
# ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz
To modify the layout, append a corresponding file name to loadkeys(1), omitting path and file extension. For example, to set a German keyboard layout:
# loadkeys de-latin1
Console fonts are located in /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/ and can likewise be set with setfont(8).
Verify the boot mode
If UEFI mode is enabled on an UEFI motherboard, Archiso will boot Arch Linux accordingly via systemd-boot. To verify this, list the efivars directory:
# ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
If the directory does not exist, the system may be booted in BIOS or CSM mode. Refer to your motherboard's manual for details.
Connect to the Internet
The installation image enables the dhcpcd daemon for wired network devices on boot. The connection may be verified with ping:
# ping archlinux.org
If no connection is available, stop the dhcpcd service with systemctl stop dhcpcd@interface where the interface name can be tab-completed, and configure the network as described in Network configuration.
Update the system clock
Use timedatectl(1) to ensure the system clock is accurate:
# timedatectl set-ntp true
To check the service status, use timedatectl status.
Partition the disks
When recognized by the live system, disks are assigned to a block device such as /dev/sda or /dev/nvme0n1
